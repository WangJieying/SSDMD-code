This software package is the technical support for our paper "Focus-and-Context Skeleton-Based Image Simplification Using Saliency Maps". 

The whole pipeline is like this: Given a grayscale image or a color image, we first thresholding it into n (256 for 8-bit images) binary images. For each binary image, or layer that we call, we first remove small 'island' or noise of it, then we extract its skeletons, then we simplify skeletons by using the saliency metric. After that all the skeleton points are stored in the so-called SIR file in the form of a tree. The SIR file is all we need to store for the original image. All of these steps implemented in the imConvert file, and imShow file is responsible for decode the SIR file and then reconstruct it back to the original image.

# 1. Building

The software needs a C++ compiler, OpenGL, the CUDA, and GLUT to build. 

Under a Debian based linux they can be installed using the following command.

* install

sudo apt-get install cuda zpaq libzstd-dev libsnappy-dev gcc git make cmake libboost-all-dev freeglut3-dev libglew-dev ragel libvala-0.40-dev glmark2 valac liblz4-dev liblzma-dev libbz2-1.0

* to build:

cd Code/imShow && make

cd ../../

cd Code/imConvert && make


# 2. Running

cd Code/imConvert

./skeletonify config.txt

cd ../imShow

./show_skeleton output.sir 

where config.txt is a configuration file. The detailed explanation is shown in the last section.


I also write a bash script to execute the whole pipeline, named 'benchmark' in the Code file.

What you need to do are: 

(a) Put images that you want to test into TestImage/somefile/someimage.ppm 

(b) Change parameters as you want in this script. These parameters include how many layers do you want to select("layers"), what 'island' threshold do you need("islandThreshold"), what saliency threshold do you need("Saliency"), etc, see the detailed explanation in the 4th section.

(c) Run ./benchmark. Then the compression ratio and the MS-SSIM score can be written into the compressRate2.txt and skeleton_msssim2.txt separately which located in 'outputFile'.


# 3. Function


imConvert
---------

This program read PGM (grayscale images) or PPM (color images) files, and convert them to the SIR file, which stands for "Skeletonal Image Representation". The main steps/functions are listed below:

* removeIslands
Remove small 'islands'/noise according to the islandThreshold variable. Notice that both "on" and "off" regions will be filtered.

* alculateImportance
This function will select layers according to the layer_selection threshold. It mainly contains two methods to select the given number layers: the cumulative histogram and local-maxima method, see our paper for detail. For those layers/intensities who are selected, their importance would be 1, otherwise that would be 0.

* removeLayers
This function is complementary to the previous one. If one layer is unimportant (done by the previous function), it would be removed. Specifically, we adjust the value of each pixel to the nearest 'important' level.

* computeSkeletons
This function calculates the skeleton for each layer and then store them into the 'forest'. 'forest' is a list of pairs of intensities/layers/levels and all corresponding paths at that intensity. The core function to calculate the skeleton is in computeSkeleton(), which uses CUDA to implement the real-time 2D skeletonization. See details at http://www.cs.rug.nl/svcg/Shapes/CUDASkel.

* write_image
In the last function, we store all skeletons of all layers in the 'forest'. This function goes through the 'forest' in a Depth First Search ( DFS ) manner, and then apply the delta-encoding method to write all skeleton pixels into the ofstream. See details in chapter 4 in yuri's master thesis: DENSE-FIELD SKELETON-BASED IMAGE REPRESENTATIONS.

* ImageWriter::save
This function applies an external compressor to compress the ofstream further. You can set what external compression method you prefer by parameter 'compression_method' in the configuration file.

imShow
---------

This program is responsible for decode the SIR file and then do the reconstruction.

* ImageDecoder::load
Load SIR file, decompress data and decode data by the function decode_plane().

* get_interp_layer
This function achieves a smooth distance-based interpolation between two neighboring layers in the Hausdorff sense. See details in the paper "A Dense Medial Descriptor for Image Analysis".

* getAlphaMapOfLayer
This function draws all disks. The alpha will be 1 at the location that should be drawn, otherwise 0. 

# 4. Other remarks


As said before, config.txt is a configuration file. The following is a detailed explanation of all parameters:

* outputLevel
This parameter controls which type do you want to output in the terminal. Available options are 'q', 'e', 'n' and 'v'. See the main function in detail.

* colorspace 
This parameter determines which color space do you want to use for color images. Options contain 'hsv', 'ycbcr'/'yuv', 'rgb' and leave it empty.

* layer_selection
This one set which layer selection method do you want to use. 'cumulative' is for cumulative histogram method, other setting or empty lead to local-maxima method.

* compression_method
This parameter controls which external compression algorithm do you want to use. 'zpaq' has been confirmed to be a very effective one.
 
* encoding
This one set which encoding method to use. 'traditional' means the delta-encoding method, which has been proved to be an effective algorithm when used with the 'zpaq' external compression. See details in the CDMD paper.

*overlap_pruning = false

*overlap_pruning_epsilon = .05

*bundle = false

*alpha = 1

*epsilon = 5

Because the overlap pruning and bundling techniques are not mature enough, we prefer not to use these two functions.

* outputFile 
This parameter indicates where to put the output file, i.e., the .sir file.

* filename
Input image, must be PGM or PPM file.

* filenameSM
Saliency map for the input image.

* num_layers
One of the most important parameters. It indicates how many layers do you want to choose. '20', '30', and '40' are good range in general.

* islandThreshold
What size of noise do you want to remove. In general, 0.001-0.02 should be a good range.

* ssThreshold
Another important parameter. It represents saliency skeleton threshold. 0.2-2 should be a good range.

* SkeletonThreshold 
This parameter is a support for the saliency skeleton. After the saliency skeleton thresholding, there will be a collection of disconnected, skeletal components. Only the longest 'core' component/fragment should be preserved. So this parameter is used to filter those small disconnected skeleton branches. See details in the paper "Feature Preserving Smoothing of Shapes using Saliency Skeletons".

* flagThreshold
When this parameter was set to 0, then we use the original island removal method (use islandThreshold), otherwise, we use saliency-based island removal metric, see Sec.3.1 in our paper.

* smThreshold
This threshold controls the amount of the non-salient areas. See the detailed explanation (Progressively simplification effect of Î¼0) in our paper 'Focus-and-Context Skeleton-Based Image Simplification Using Saliency Maps'.

* distinguishable_interval
This one is a support for the layer selection procedure. It represents the smallest gray level difference that the human eye can recognize. It is set to 5 in general.
